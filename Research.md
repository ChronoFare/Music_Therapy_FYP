## Music Therapy Assessment Game (M-TAG)

### Benefits of video game rehabilitation and Virtual Reality (VR) therapy
Research shows that "VR-based rehabilitation combined with conventional occupational therapy (COT) may improve the upper extremity functions and decrease caregiver burden among children with CP" [1]. Moreover, benefits include increasing interactivity and motivation [1]. Game based therapy is also time efficient, low cost, easy to implement anf clinically effective [2]. 

Games can be categorized to the patients needed area of treatment within the upper extremities region; categories can include coordination and timing. Based on the patient's progress, the occupational therapists (OT) can customise the difficulty level [1]. This allows moderation of the complexity of the movements required.

### Current technology on the market 
Current advances in technology introduced the [Gloreha Sinfonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OewQiHHexhE) shows a full-sized upper limb focused rehabilitation device [5]. However, the downside of this device is:
1. Not portablility
2. Expensive
3. Focuses on the technical part, not the musical aspect of therapy.

### Solution: Integrating Music Therapy with VR Rehabilitation
By marrying the idea of music therapy with VR rehabilitation, we can reap the benefits of engaging the patient's interests while keeping their rehabilitation program on track. 

By tracking the patients movements, feedback can be used by the OT to make informed adjustments, or even automated by the program; reducing the constant need of OTs to be there.

Pros:
1. Portable
2. Inexpensive

### Chosen Assessment Test for M-TAG 
The Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) is to be chosen as our measure for assessment for its reliability and validility. QUEST is validated for children aging 18 months to 8 years [1]. As our target group is primarily children and adolescents, QUEST is more suitable in this aspect. As QUEST is developed by therapists for therapist, the test benefits from its quality in describing movement and selecting programs catered to the patient's needs. Moreover it has evidential prove of reliability, validity, and responsiveness [1].
