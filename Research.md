## Music Therapy Assessment Game (M-TAG)

**Benefits of video game rehabilitation and Virtual Reality (VR) therapy**
Research shows that "VR-based rehabilitation combined with COT may improve the upper extremity functions and decrease caregiver burden among children with CP" [1]. 


**Chosen Assessment Test for M-TAG**
The Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) is to be chosen as our measure for assessment for its reliability and validility. 

**Current technology on the market**
Current advances in technology introduced the [Gloreha Sinfonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OewQiHHexhE) shows a full-sized upper limb focused rehabilitation device.  However, the downside of this device is:
1. Not portablility
2. Expensive
3. Focuses on the technical part, not the musical aspect of therapy.
