## Week 0
[8-12 March 2021) 
This week is reserved for the setting of the programs and handover from the previous intern.

Sean (the previous intern) had briefed me on the programs and issues pertaining to the current "games" for rehabiliation. 

***Side Note**: Dr, Kumar gave me the unique opportunity to work with Sean to finalise and participate in the Lee Hsien Loong IDM Smart Nation Competition.*

For this project, programs we are using include:
 - Visual Studios 2019 (C# Codes)
 - Unity 3D [version 2018.4.18] (Game Development)
 - Unity Hub (Stores Games Used)

## Week 1
Dr. Arun Kumar outlined the core problems of the project to be resolved by me in the following weeks.
1. Story Telling Game (Associate pictures to game sounds via MIDI)
2. Research on current solutions to music therapy and explore the methods of evaluation; their flaws, how it can be improved.
3. Add sustain code to piano notes during songs.
4. Add auto-adjust sound codes to instrument from dropdown list.
5.  Integrate Machine Learning from data sourced from games.

**Conceive**
As this project encompasses around rehabilition for the upper limbs (a.k.a. upper extremities), I researched available solutions and issues faced by users. 

To accustom myself to the new programs required for the project, I have used online resources such as websites and learning platforms to learn the basics of :  
1. Visual Studios's programming language, C# : [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/default.asp) and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/visual-studio-essential-training-05-code-editors/explore-the-default-editor-settings?u=2122804) to learn the basics of C#. 
2. Unity 3D : Completed the "[Roll a Ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball)" tutorial to learn basics of Unity program.
3. MIDI :
